   The limitations of C language are evident when a software project is too large to be
handled. In some circumstances, errors occur at some place and some patch up programs is
added to rectify that error. These programs introduce an unexpected error at some other
location and this process continues. In 1980 Bjarne Stroustrup addressed this problem by
adding several extensions to C language. The most important addition was the concept of
CLASS. The additions made were mainly aimed at extending the language in such a way that
it supports object-oriented programming.
